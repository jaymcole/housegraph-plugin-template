# Node library rules

Rules for building a HouseGraph **node library** — a jar of node types that
HouseGraph fetches from a GitHub repository and loads at runtime.

Every rule here has a **silent** failure mode. Break one and you get a node that
never appears, logging that vanishes, or a saved graph that cannot find its nodes
again — usually with nothing in the log to explain why. That is why they are
collected rather than left to be rediscovered.

## 1. `compileOnly` the API — never `implementation`

```groovy
compileOnly 'com.github.jaymcole:HouseGraph:v2.0.0'
```

HouseGraph supplies `housegraph-api` and its transitive `org.json` and `slf4j-api`
from its own class loader.

Bundling the API gives your library its own copy of `BaseNode`, so every node in it
fails the host's `isAssignableFrom` check during discovery and **never appears**.
Bundling `slf4j-api` gives you a second logging binding with no outputs attached, so
**all your log lines silently vanish**.

The installer rejects a jar containing either, to turn those into one clear message.

## 2. Relocate everything you bundle

**All installed libraries share one class loader.** Two libraries bundling
different versions of the same dependency would fight over it.

Anything declared `implementation` ends up in the shaded jar and needs a `relocate`
line:

```groovy
shadowJar {
    relocate 'com.example.whatever', 'io.github.you.yourlib.shaded.whatever'
    mergeServiceFiles()
}
```

## 3. Keep `mergeServiceFiles()`

Any bundled library that uses `ServiceLoader` — DJL's engine discovery, JDBC
drivers — breaks without it, at runtime, with a confusing "no provider found".

## 4. Always `@Node.Type`, prefixed with your library id

```java
@Node.Type("housegraph-yourthing.DoTheThing")
```

This pins the id your node is written under in save files, independent of its class
name. Two things follow:

- **Renaming or moving the class no longer strands saved graphs.** Without it, the
  save-file id is the simple class name.
- **You do not collide with another library.** Your library shares an id space with
  every other installed library, so an unprefixed `SendMessage` is one collision
  away from resolving to somebody else's node.

You cannot fix either after the fact without asking users to hand-edit save files.

## 5. Tag every node so search can find it

```java
@Display.Name("Send Message")
@Display.Description("Posts a message to a Discord channel.")
@Node.Kind(NodeKind.ACTION)
@Node.Keywords({"discord", "post", "chat", "say", "notify"})
```

HouseGraph ranks nodes by their name, class name, description, keywords, category and
library. Skip these and your node is findable only by someone who already knows what it
is called — which, in a list of every installed library's nodes, is nobody.

- **`@Node.Keywords` does the most work.** It is what surfaces your node to a user
  searching for the words they would use rather than the words you chose.
- **`@Node.Kind` is the node's role** — `ACTION`, `CONTROL`, `RESOURCE` or `DATA` — not
  its category. Category is your `categoryPrefix` and menu position; kind cuts across it.

**A node with no `@Node.Kind` matches no `kind:` search at all.** Nothing is inferred
from your category path, because it is yours to name and means nothing to the host. The
only fallback is `AutoStartable`, which implies `RESOURCE`.

These three annotations landed in **v1.1.0**. Against an earlier API they will not
compile — check the version you pinned in rule 1.

Note the same `javafx.scene.Node` collision that bites `@Node.Type` (see rule 4 and the
section below) applies to `@Node.Kind` and `@Node.Keywords`.

## 6. Apply the JavaFX Gradle plugin

```groovy
plugins { id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '...' }
```

HouseGraph's published metadata names JavaFX **without** a platform classifier on
purpose, so a release built on Linux cannot pin the wrong natives into your build.
The consequence is that the unclassified artifacts OpenJFX publishes are ~300-byte
stubs. Without the plugin you get `package javafx.scene does not exist`.

## 7. Exclude `slf4j-api` from every dependency that pulls it

```groovy
implementation('net.dv8tion:JDA:5.x') {
    exclude group: 'org.slf4j', module: 'slf4j-api'
}
```

Otherwise it lands in your shaded jar and rule 1 rejects it.

**Apply the exclude to every coordinate with its own path to the module, not just
the one you declared.** JDA and jmdns each need one. DJL needs three — `ai.djl:api`,
`ai.djl.pytorch:pytorch-model-zoo` and `ai.djl.pytorch:pytorch-engine` each pull
their own transitive path to `ai.djl:api`, so an exclude on one does not cover
another. Check with `gradlew :yourlib:dependencies` before you build.

## 8. A node with a Start/Stop lifecycle must survive having no UI

`createNodeContent()` runs only when something draws your node, so every field it
assigns is null otherwise — and "otherwise" is not only a headless run: a graph used
from inside another graph has no view for its interior nodes while the app around it
is fully windowed. **Whether a node has a view is a question about that node, never
about the process.** Do not key any of this off `sdk.RuntimeMode.isDaemon()`, which
answers whether a supervisor started the JVM.

```java
private volatile boolean running;                       // 1. not "timeline != null"
private final NodeTimer clock = new NodeTimer("MyBot"); // 2. not a Timeline

private void start() {
    running = true;
    connect();
    clock.start(30_000, this::heartbeat);
    present(() -> status.setText("Connected"));         // 3. not a bare setText
}

@Override public Map<String, String> saveState() {
    return running ? Map.of("running", "true") : Map.of();
}

@Override protected void onRemoved() {
    running = false;
    clock.stop();
}
```

1. **Own the running flag.** A field on the node. A `saveState()` that reports
   `running` by testing whether a control or a `Timeline` exists is reading the UI,
   and `AutoStartable` then cannot round-trip through a loader that built none.
2. **`sdk.NodeTimer`, not `javafx.animation.Timeline`**, which ticks only while the
   toolkit runs. `NodeTimer` ticks wherever the node is: a shared daemon scheduler,
   one virtual thread per tick, a tick skipped rather than overlapped if its
   predecessor is still running. `stop()` is idempotent and immediate, so it belongs
   in `onRemoved()`.
3. **`BaseNode.present(Runnable)` for every control update.** It runs the block
   through the sink the node's view installed and discards it when there is no view.
   The host runs it inline if you are already on the FX thread and marshals it there
   if you are not — which is what makes a `NodeTimer` tick safe to show something.
   Read your node's state *inside* the block; it may run later than the call.
   `BaseNode.hasView()` asks the question directly, for skipping work that exists
   only to feed a control.

`AutoStartable.autoStartIfWasRunning()` is where this pays off: **its thread is the
loader's**, not promised to be the FX thread, and the node it reaches may never have
been drawn.

These are **additions** to the API — against an older version they will not compile,
so bump the version you pinned in rule 1. Nothing forces the change: a library that
ignores them behaves exactly as it always has in a window, and stays exactly as
broken outside one. Outside one is no longer hypothetical: `housegraph run --headless
<graph>` loads a graph with no canvas, and a node that skips these throws a
`NullPointerException` out of its own `start()` the moment that runner resumes it.
The runner survives it — the node is left stopped, the rest of the graph runs, and
the log names the node and this file — but that node does nothing until the library
is fixed.

## Things that will bite you otherwise

**Do not import `javafx.scene.Node`.** `@Node.Type`, `@Node.Kind` and
`@Node.Keywords` all come from `io.github.jaymcole.housegraph.annotations.Node`, and
`NodeContentProvider.createNodeContent()` returns `javafx.scene.Node`. Both are
named `Node`. Write `javafx.scene.Node` fully qualified at each use, or import the
nested annotation types directly (`import ...annotations.Node.Kind;`) and write
`@Kind(...)`. This only bites when a node combines the two, so it is easy to miss until
it happens — and now that every node should be tagged, it happens more often.

**A node's static initializer runs at first instantiation, not at discovery.** The
host loads classes with `initialize = false`. So a type registered from a static
block — `ValueEditors.register(...)`, `TypeConverters.register(...)` — only takes
effect once one of your nodes exists. The symptom of assuming otherwise is "my
custom type isn't editable until I place the node twice." Registering from the
constructor avoids the question.

**`onExecuted()` reaches you on the JavaFX thread**, dispatched through the host's
callback executor, so your UI code needs no `Platform.runLater`. Work *you* start —
a socket bind, an HTTP call, a gateway login — does: keep it off the FX thread and
hop back to show the result.

**Split your teardown.** `onRemoved()` runs on the removing thread and is not time
bounded — use it for fast, thread-affine work such as stopping a `NodeTimer` or
unregistering a name. Anything that waits on the outside world (reaping a child
process, withdrawing an mDNS registration, logging a client out) goes in
`releaseResources()`, which runs on a worker under a per-node limit, concurrently
with every other node's. Both must be idempotent, and both must work even if the
node's UI was never built.

**Throwing out of `process()` is how a node reports failure, and the engine acts on
it.** This is the behaviour of **v2.0.0** and later; against an earlier API a throw was
logged and the run cascaded downstream anyway, which is why older nodes sometimes
activate a port defensively before the work that might fail. Every node has an engine-owned `Error` flow-out and an `Error Message` output
you do not declare. Under the default `FailurePolicy.HALT` a throw fires the `Error`
port, halts the branch, and **discards any port you activated before throwing** — so
a node no longer has to call `activate` ahead of the work that might fail to stop a
failure looking like a success. Throw with a message worth reading: it becomes
`Error Message`, and it is all a handler gets.

The corollary is that **catching an exception and returning normally is now a lie.**
It tells the engine the node succeeded, and everything downstream runs against
outputs the node never set. If a failure is genuinely not a failure — a poll that
found nothing — say so with a port, not with a silent return.

**Mark an input `required()` when the node is meaningless without it.** A required
input whose producer failed fails your node too, before `process()` runs. An optional
one does not. This is what keeps a send from running against the last image a camera
successfully took.

**The asset name matters if you publish several libraries from one repository.**
HouseGraph matches a library to its jar as `<pluginId>-<version>-all.jar`. With a
single library in the repository there is nothing to disambiguate and any name
works.

## What you can use

Everything in `housegraph-api`:

| Package | Provides |
| --- | --- |
| `graph` | `BaseNode`, `NodeVariable`, `FlowPort`, `Edge`, `ProcessContext`, `ExecutionPolicy`, `TypeConverters` |
| `annotations` | `@Display.Name`, `@Display.Description`, `@Node.Type`, `@Node.Kind`, `@Node.Keywords`, `@Node.Disabled` |
| `sdk` | `NodeContentProvider` (inline JavaFX UI), `AutoStartable` (resume on load), `NodeTimer` (a toolkit-free clock), `NodePresentation` (behind `BaseNode.present`), `ValueEditors`, `Secrets`, `RuntimeMode` |
| `logging` | `Log.get(YourClass.class)` — lands in HouseGraph's own log window and file |
| `resource` | `ResourceRegistry` — long-lived resources referenced by name rather than wired |
| `storage`, `store` | `AppDirectories`, `SecretsStore`, `JsonDocumentStore` |

`NodeContentProvider`, `AutoStartable` and `ValueEditors` are dispatched by the host
with `instanceof`, so implementing one is the entire opt-in. **Resolve secrets through `sdk.Secrets`**,
not `SecretsStore` directly — it does nothing different today, but it is the seam a
per-library grant would be added behind.

**The API is not stable yet.** Expect to rebuild against new versions.

## Node design: control or action, not both

A node should almost always be **either** control-oriented **or** action-oriented.

- **Control nodes** shape *when* and *how often* flow moves: a trigger, a timer, a
  branch, a loop, a join. Their job is deciding whether something downstream runs,
  not doing that something. HouseGraph's built-in library already ships the common
  ones, so a library rarely needs to reinvent one.
- **Action nodes** *do* something: call an API, read a sensor, write a file,
  transform data. Their flow outputs report that the node ran and, at most, which of
  a few known outcomes happened **for that one invocation** — not points on a
  schedule the node manages itself.

A node that owns its own timer *and* performs an external action duplicates a
repeating-trigger node that already exists, and cannot be reused on a different
schedule. Split it: give the action a flow-in and let a repeating trigger wired
upstream decide when it fires.

**That also makes it directly testable.** An action node with a flow-in is
exercised by calling `process()` on it. A node that owns its own timer has to have
that timer spun up and torn down before you can test the thing you actually care
about.

**If a request describes a node that would both schedule its own execution and
perform an external action, treat that as a smell** — ask whether it should be two
composable nodes before building the fused version.

**The exception is a resource node that owns a real connection lifecycle** — a bot,
a web server. There Start/Stop and state genuinely belong to the same node, because
the connection *is* what is being managed. Treat that as a named exception, not as
precedent for fusing scheduling into an ordinary action node.

---

## A word about trust

A node library runs **inside HouseGraph's JVM with the user's full privileges**:
their files, their network, their saved secrets. There is no sandbox —
`SecurityManager` is gone in Java 21+ and the module system carries no permission
model.

Installing a node library is exactly as dangerous as running any other program you
downloaded, and HouseGraph says so when installing one. Treat other people's trust
accordingly: say plainly what your library does, and do not ask for a secret you do
not need.
